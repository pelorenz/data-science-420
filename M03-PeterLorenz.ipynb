    "## 4. Summarize your findings\n",
    "In this section, we summarize the findings of our three milestones, focusing on what the models we have developed can tell us about how to optimize the diaper manufacturing process. The overall business objective, as noted in Assignment 1, is to detect problems that might potentially lead to a poor quality product. So quality is the driving motivation behind our model. But as we noted in Milestone 2, there is an inherent balance between quality and cost. A model that tells us to monitor all sensors constantly may end up producing quality products, but would drive up costs to an unreasonable level. More fundamentally, it would nullify the purpose of having a model in the first place to direct us where to focus our energy for maximum efficiency. With this business objective in view, we now evaluate our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Networks\n",
    "In the present milestone, we developed three neural networks. Our first neural network was a simple network with no hidden layers, providing an opportunity co compute class weights and align our inputs to the necessary dimensions. Our second neural network added a single hidden layer. We found that adding additional layers did not improve accuracy, so we left this model with a single hidden layer. Both of our first two models used the SGD optimizer and binary cross entropy loss function with RELU activation functions, except in the output layers, which used softmax. Neither of these initial models performed well. However, our third neural network, a recurrent neural network (RNN), achieved an impressive accuracy of nearly 96%. This model used three LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers and a dense layer for the output layer along with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross entropy for the loss function. In five epochs it was able to converge with an accuracy consistently above 95%. \n",
    "Since in-depth \"X-ray\" analysis of our neural network was not included in the initial contract, it is not immediately clear which sensors contributed most to the success of the model. This kind of analysis would be a potential next step to consider for a future contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "In Milestone 1, we identified ten sensors (out of 590 initial sensors) that represent the best predictors of the target variable based on stepwise selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. s22\n",
    "1. s34\n",
    "1. s65\n",
    "1. s104\n",
    "1. s125\n",
    "1. s130\n",
    "1. s144\n",
    "1. s189\n",
    "1. s313\n",
    "1. s438\n",
    "\n",
    "This selection of feature gives us an idea as to which sensors are potentially the most significant in predicting product defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machine\n",
    "In Milestone 2, we developed a support vector machine that had some success in predicting defects using this list of features. This model delivered a 67% recall (despite a not-so-impressive precision of 5%) with AUC of 0.72:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pelorenz/data-science-420/raw/master/svm-auc.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While far less accurate than our RNN model, the SVM offers some confirmation that the ten sensors identified in feature selection are helpful predictors of potential defects. We recommend focusing on these sensors to optimize manufacturing for the reduction of defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "As mentioned, the model with the highest accuracy was our final recurrent neural network, with nearly 96% accuracy. Given the black-box nature of neural networks in general, this metric supplied us with our best (and only) means of evaluating this model. The question that remains is whether this model performed well enough in production. Given the high degree of accuracy, we recommend a trial program to test the success of the model in production. This trial would provide empirical data to assess the model's performance in a live setting. The results of the trial would let us know whether the model is sufficiently accurate in a real-life setting to rely on more extensively. In addition, the trial would supply us with more labeled data to feed into the model to improve accuracy. One limitation of the present model is the fact that it was trained on only 1252 data points out of a total of just 1566. Having more data would certainly have improved our confidence as to the production-readiness of the model. Collecting additional data while the model is in trial will allow us to further improve the model and prepare for releasing it fully into production.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we have shown the benefits of applying a neural network (RNN) to data that proved difficult to model with convential methods, such as decision trees, ensemble models, and support vector classifiers. Our highest accuracy with these methods was 67% using the support vector classifier. Our best neural network, a recurrent network, achieved an accuracy of 96%, allowing us to plan for a production trial. This trial will allow us to collect additional labeled data to improve the model further in preparation for a full launch into production. With the model in production, we should be able to gauge when products are not meeting quality standards simply by feeding the sensors into the model, allowing us to optimize for quality by relying on the model."
